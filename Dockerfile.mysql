# Custom MySQL image for CBL Sales Orders application
FROM mysql:8.0

# Copy custom MySQL configuration with Bangladesh timezone
COPY my.cnf /etc/mysql/conf.d/

# Copy database schema into the image
# This ensures the schema is baked into the image and doesn't depend on host filesystem

# Keep the default MySQL entrypoint
# Environment variables and database initialization are handled by docker-compose.yml
